# Student-Pass-Fail-Analysis
🔍 Project Overview This project focuses on predicting whether a student will pass or fail based on two critical academic factors: study hours per week and class attendance percentage. Using a Logistic Regression model, the goal is to classify students as either passing (1) or failing (0) based on these inputs.
